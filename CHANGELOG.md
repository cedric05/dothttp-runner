# Change Log


## Known issues
- notebook search with `m` or `y` in key won't work, as vscode configured default shortcut `m` to change cell to markdown and is annoying. [remove](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_keyboard-shortcuts-editor) `m` and `y` shortcuts for clean experience.
